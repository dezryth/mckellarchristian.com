You found our family blog! We will be sharing pictures and stories of our lives together. Here's a couple fun facts for now:

Mary and I were married on Saturday December 2nd, 2023.
We live in a little place in Carrollton with more animals than we probably should have including six chickens, two dogs, and a cat named Steve.
Here is a visualization to put that into perspective: 🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐔🐕🐩😼

Plan to find (some of) our stories here. 😁
Thanks for stopping by!
